                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>While I specialize in AI and Data Science, I have also honed my Web Development skills, thanks to Prodigy                   InfoTech. During my internship, I've achieved the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Created an Interactive Navigation Menu</li><br>
                    <li>Developed a Stopwatch Web Application</li><br>
                    <li>Designed a Tic-Tac-Toe web Application</li><br>
                    <li>Crafted this portfolio</li><br>
                    <li>Currently working on a Weather Application</li><br>
                </ul>

                <p>Beyond web development, I've completed projects like:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a Face Recognition Application that provides users with the flexibility to choose between                       Haar Cascade and HOG-based detection methods, offering a comparison of accuracy and detection time.                           Additionally, an anti-spoofing mechanism was integrated to enhance security and prevent unauthorized                          access using printed or phone-displayed images, utilizing OpenCV, Python, and Convolutional Neural                            Networks (CNN).
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Detecting Phishing Websites using ANN (Python)</li><br>
                    <li>Detecting Deepfake Videos using CNN</li><br>
                    <li>Developed a Honeypot Server to trap hackers and malicious users (Dionaea, Glastopf)</li><br>
                    <li>Designed a comprehensive website using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP,                        establishing a seamless platform for architects and clients to collaborate in the creation of                                 personalized land sketches. This user-friendly platform enables clients to connect with architects,                           provide land details, and request custom sketches. Architects receive compensation for their work, with                       payment determined by the platform, based on the complexity and time required for each sketch.</li><br>
                </ul>

                <p>These projects reflect my versatile skill set and passion for technology.</p>
